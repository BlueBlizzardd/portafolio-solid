#### Description

This is a portfolio made to showcase all of my current knowledge in the world of CSS and JS frameworks, also using TypeScript. It was made as part of the CS50x 2024 course, and as such, I also took the opportunity to pursue a lot of knowledge and improve in some areas I felt I was lacking in, while also experimenting with new ideas and technologies. Also of notice is the fact that this project was built initially as a React project, using TanStack Router as a way to organize routes (link to that project [here](https://github.com/BlueBlizzardd/portafolio-tanstack)). I later changed my mind and pursued building this personal website using SolidJS, as a way to practice another framework and pursue more perspectives.

Since I took a lot of time to decide on which technology I would use for the project, and since I already made a lot of the app already using React, this implements the same structure and functional-component base that modern React also uses. This includes separating the files into routes which are themselves components, making a single component that holds the "layout" for a bunch of pages, and separating some of the more common UI elements on separate components with separate CSS files for colocation.

Additionally, some of the more out there ideas that were implemented and experimented on during this project were the following:

- CSS animations and transitions.
- CSS @scope rule and component encapsulation.
- Solid router, using another framework that is NOT React to showcase a little bit of its strengths.
- Folder organization and structuring of a bigger project.
